# AI Tool Governance: The 4-Phase Lifecycle

**Purpose:** Visual timeline showing the complete governance journey from assessment through optimization

**Visual Style:** Horizontal timeline or phased roadmap with milestones

**Key Activities:**
- Week 1: Discovery (amnesty audit + IT discovery)
- Week 2: Build (tool selection + DLP config + account provisioning)
- Week 3: Deploy (training + go-live + monitoring)

**Deliverable:** Approved toolkit live with trained users

**Exit Criteria:** Tools deployed, training complete, DLP monitoring active

**Note:** "Use the Shadow AI Governance Toolkit for detailed 3-week implementation plan"

## Visual Design Notes:

**Layout:** Left-to-right horizontal timeline with 4 distinct phases

**Phase Connectors:** Arrows or flow lines between phases showing progression

**For Each Phase Include:**
- Phase number (1-4) and name prominently
- Timeline duration
- Icon representing the phase
- 3-5 key activities (bullets)
- Deliverable/outcome
- Exit criteria or success metric

**Visual Elements:**
- Progress bar showing where most organizations are (most complete Phase 2, few reach Phase 4)
- Milestone markers at phase boundaries
- Color-coded backgrounds matching phase colors

**Title:** "AI Tool Governance: The Complete Lifecycle"

**Subtitle:** "From chaos to competitive advantage in 4 phases"

**Footer:** "Scott Armbruster | AI Governance Workshops"

**Callout Box:** "Most organizations stop after Phase 2 and wonder why governance fails. Phases 3-4 make it sustainable."
