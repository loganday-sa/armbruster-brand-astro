5. Then create #3-6 based on what's resonating

### **Option B: Full Suite (If design capacity available)**
1. Create all 6 infographics upfront
2. Add #1 and #2 as hero images
3. Embed #3-6 throughout the pages
4. Create comprehensive PDFs with full visual suite
5. Use #3-6 for social media campaign

3. **Review the output** and refine the prompt if needed
4. **Extract the refined content** to brief your designer or AI image generator

## 🗑️ Note: These Are Throwaway Files

These `.infographic-source-*.md` files are:
- NOT part of the website content
- Prefixed with `.` so they're hidden/ignored
- Safe to delete after infographics are created
- Just input material for NotebookLM

Once you have the final infographics, you can delete these source files.
