# Brand Voice Guidelines - Scott Armbruster

## Brand Positioning & Mission

**Core Mission:** Bridge the gap between AI knowledge and AI implementation—helping professionals and organizations move from curious to confident to capable.

## 1. Editorial Philosophy

### Principle 1: Implementation Over Information
Content should move readers toward action, not just understanding. Every piece must include clear next steps.

### Principle 2: Specificity Beats Generality
Use real numbers, actual tools, specific scenarios. Avoid vague promises or abstract concepts.

### Principle 3: Bridge Builder Mindset
Always connect theory to practice, strategy to tactics, learning to doing. Show the path forward.

### Principle 4: Results-First Reporting
Lead with outcomes and benefits, then explain the how. Focus on what readers will achieve.

### Principle 5: Anti-Hype Authority
Call out unrealistic expectations, acknowledge limitations, provide balanced perspectives on AI capabilities.

## 10. Voice Transformation Examples

### Example 1: Generic AI → Scott's Voice

**Generic AI Writing:**
"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way businesses operate in today's digital landscape. Organizations that embrace these transformative technologies will find themselves at a significant competitive advantage. It's important to note that implementing AI solutions requires careful consideration of various factors."

**Scott's Voice:**
"Your competitor just deployed an AI system that handles 80% of their customer service. They're saving $10K monthly. You're still debating whether AI is 'ready.' Here's the thing—AI isn't coming. It's here, it's working, and someone in your industry is already using it to eat your lunch."

### Example 2: Listicle Filler → Scott's Voice

**Listicle Filler:**
"There are numerous AI tools available in the market today that can help streamline your workflow and boost productivity. Let's explore some of the top options that industry leaders are leveraging to transform their operations."

**Scott's Voice:**
"I've tested 47 AI tools in the last six months. Most are overpriced ChatGPT wrappers. But these three actually moved the needle: Cursor IDE cut my coding time by 70%. n8n automated my entire lead workflow. Perplexity replaced four research assistants. Total cost: $97/month. Total time saved: 20 hours weekly."

### Example 3: Corporate Speak → Scott's Voice

**Corporate Speak:**
"Our comprehensive AI implementation framework enables organizations to leverage cutting-edge machine learning capabilities while ensuring stakeholder alignment and maximizing ROI through strategic deployment initiatives."

**Scott's Voice:**
"We install AI systems that work. Three phases: Week 1, we map your workflows. Week 2-3, we build and test. Week 4, you're saving 20+ hours. No consultants camping in your conference room. No 200-page strategy decks. Just working systems that deliver measurable results."

### Example 4: Academic Theory → Scott's Voice

**Academic Theory:**
"The convergence of natural language processing and business process automation represents a paradigm shift in organizational efficiency. Studies indicate that early adopters of these technologies experience significant operational improvements across multiple performance metrics."

**Scott's Voice:**
"I helped a 6-person nonprofit reclaim 20 hours every week using AI they already had access to. No fancy enterprise tools. Just ChatGPT, Google Workspace, and basic automation. They went from drowning in admin work to focusing on their mission. That's the only metric that matters—time back to do real work."

## 12. DALL-E Image Generation Guidelines

### Base Style Prompt

When generating images for this site via DALL-E, always include the following base style instructions in every prompt:

> Create an image in a refined, cinematic illustration style that uses a limited color palette of deep blues, soft oranges, and warm ambient lighting. The visual mood should feel calm, focused, and professional. The scene should use strong contrast between warm light sources and cool surrounding shadows, similar to digital paintings lit by a single lamp or screen glow. Characters and objects should be rendered with clean lines, subtle gradients, and a slightly stylized, modern editorial illustration quality.

### Brand Attributes (Always Include)

Every DALL-E prompt must enforce these attributes:

- Professional, thoughtful tone
- Minimalist composition
- Warm key light on the main subject with cool shadows
- Smooth textures and subtle shading
- A sense of deep concentration or intentional action
- Slightly stylized human figures without exaggerated proportions
- Consistent brand aesthetic across all images
- **Absolutely no text, no letters, no numbers, and no visible writing anywhere in the image**

### Color Palette

- **Primary:** Deep blues (backgrounds, shadows)
- **Accent:** Soft oranges (key light, warm highlights)
- **Lighting:** Warm ambient lighting with strong contrast
- **Shadows:** Cool-toned surrounding shadows

### Composition Rules

- Single focal subject with minimal clutter
- Cinematic framing with intentional negative space
- Light source typically from a lamp, screen, or warm directional source
- Clean lines and subtle gradients over busy detail
- Modern editorial illustration quality

### Mandatory Negative Constraint

Always append to every prompt:
> Absolutely no text, no letters, no numbers, and no visible writing anywhere in the image

### Example Prompt Structure

```
[Scene description specific to post topic]. Create an image in a refined, cinematic illustration style that uses a limited color palette of deep blues, soft oranges, and warm ambient lighting. The visual mood should feel calm, focused, and professional. The scene should use strong contrast between warm light sources and cool surrounding shadows, similar to digital paintings lit by a single lamp or screen glow. Characters and objects should be rendered with clean lines, subtle gradients, and a slightly stylized, modern editorial illustration quality. Maintain a professional, thoughtful tone with minimalist composition. Warm key light on the main subject with cool shadows. Smooth textures and subtle shading. A sense of deep concentration or intentional action. Slightly stylized human figures without exaggerated proportions. Absolutely no text, no letters, no numbers, and no visible writing anywhere in the image.
