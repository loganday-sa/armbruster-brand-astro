## Decision Framework Overlay

**START HERE:** "Where are your users/customers located?"

**Decision Path 1: EU Users**
→ EU AI Act applies
→ Classify system (High/Limited/Minimal risk)
→ If High Risk: Full compliance required by Aug 2026
→ GDPR also applies if processing personal data

**Decision Path 2: US Users**
→ Federal laws depend on USE CASE:
  - Hiring? → EEOC + possibly state laws
  - Lending? → ECOA + FCRA
  - Healthcare? → FDA + HIPAA
  - Housing? → Fair Housing Act
→ State laws depend on GEOGRAPHY:
  - Colorado users? → SB 24-205 (2026)
  - NYC hiring? → Local Law 144 (now)
  - California? → AB 2930 + watch pending bills

**Decision Path 3: Global**
→ Most restrictive regulation applies
→ Usually EU AI Act for high-risk systems
→ Plus sector-specific US federal laws
→ Plus applicable state laws
