# AI System Risk Classification Infographic

**Purpose:** Decision flowchart to classify AI systems by risk tier under EU AI Act and US regulations

**Visual Style:** Flowchart with color-coded risk levels and decision points

---

## Decision Flow Structure

### START: "What Type of AI System Do You Have?"

**Question Format:** Use decision diamonds with YES/NO paths

---

### Decision Point 1
**Question:** "Does your AI manipulate, exploit, or surveil people in prohibited ways?"

**Examples shown:** Social scoring, mass surveillance, subliminal manipulation, exploiting vulnerabilities

**YES Path →**
- **Risk Tier:** UNACCEPTABLE RISK (RED - BANNED)
- **Icon:** Stop sign / Prohibited symbol
- **Action:** "Do not deploy. Stop development immediately."
- **Regulatory Note:** "Prohibited under EU AI Act"

**NO Path →** Continue to Decision Point 2

---

### Decision Point 2
**Question:** "Does your AI make or significantly influence decisions about people in sensitive areas?"

**Examples shown:** Hiring, lending, healthcare, law enforcement, education, insurance, housing

**YES Path →**
- **Risk Tier:** HIGH RISK (ORANGE - HEAVY COMPLIANCE)
- **Icon:** Alert triangle / Compliance checklist
- **Requirements:**
  - Impact assessment required
  - Bias audit (annual)
  - Technical documentation
  - Human oversight
  - Ongoing monitoring
- **Regulatory Note:** "EU AI Act Articles 6-7 | NYC Local Law 144 | Colorado SB 24-205"

**NO Path →** Continue to Decision Point 3

---

### Decision Point 3
**Question:** "Does your AI interact with users, generate content, or create synthetic media?"

**Examples shown:** Chatbots, AI-generated text/images, deepfakes, emotion recognition

**YES Path →**
- **Risk Tier:** LIMITED RISK (YELLOW - DISCLOSURE REQUIRED)
- **Icon:** Information symbol / Transparency badge
- **Requirements:**
  - Disclose AI interaction to users
  - Label AI-generated content
  - Watermark synthetic media
  - Basic system documentation
- **Regulatory Note:** "EU AI Act Article 52 | Transparency obligations"

**NO Path →** Final Classification

---

### Final Classification
**If NO to all questions:**
- **Risk Tier:** MINIMAL RISK (GREEN - VOLUNTARY)
- **Icon:** Checkmark / Green light
- **Requirements:** "No specific AI regulations apply"
- **Examples shown:** Spam filters, video games, inventory management, weather prediction
- **Note:** "Follow general software best practices"

## Visual Design Notes:

**Layout:** Top-to-bottom flowchart with clear decision paths

**Color System:**
- Red = Unacceptable Risk (STOP)
- Orange = High Risk (COMPLY)
- Yellow = Limited Risk (DISCLOSE)
- Green = Minimal Risk (PROCEED)

**For Each Risk Tier Box Include:**
- Risk level name + color badge
- 2-3 example use cases
- Key requirements (bullets)
- Relevant regulations cited

**Decision Diamonds:** Use neutral color (gray/blue) with clear YES/NO labels on paths

**Title:** "EU AI Act Risk Classification: Is Your AI System Compliant?"

**Subtitle:** "Classify your AI system in 3 questions to understand compliance requirements"

**Footer:** "Scott Armbruster | AI Compliance & Governance"

**Side Note Box:** "High-risk systems require full compliance before deployment. Penalties: up to €35M or 7% global revenue."
